8. the student is able to use sparse matrices to compute dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors for large matrices 
9. the student is able to numerically integrate systems of ordinary differential equations 
10. the student is able to write reports documenting how the matlab programs work and discuss their limitations.

### Course Conten

In this course you will be given an overview of the theory of discrete and continuous dynamical systems (first period), as well as a foundation in the most commonly applied numerical algorithms used to solve algebraic and dynamic problems (second period) found in concrete applications. 
 
Dynamical Systems part: 
1. Discrete-time dynamical systems: graphical methods to draw orbits, calculating fixed points, stability analysis, period doubling. 
2. Ordinary Differential Equations in 1 and 2 dimensions: graphical methods, linearisation, phase plane analysis, classification of steady states. 
3. General theory of linear ODEs, solving initial value problems. 
 
Numerical part 
1. Introduction in Matlab programming 
2. Finding roots of systems of nonlinear equations 
3. Interpolation, Least Squares 
4. Fast Fourier Transforms, analysing signals 
5. Computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Pagerank 
6. Numerical derivatives and integrals of functions. 
7. Numerical methods for ODEs

### Teaching Methods

lectures, tutorials, computer labs

### Method of Assessment

Written exam (part 1) and computer programming exercises (part 2). Both form 50% of the grade and both need to be passed to complete the entire course. There is a resit for the first exam but none for the second part. Students that have not passed the second part by a small margin (max 0.5 pt) get the opportunity to hand in one or more additional assignments to obtain a sufficient grade.
